# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Overview
Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project you will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.


## Contents
Inside this folder, there are 2 python notebooks:

One with the original notebook from Udacity, completed and in the format required for submission;
One with my formating, where I condensed the funcitons definitions in the beginning, as well as made easaier to test new parameters

#### Obs: this projects uses AWS' Sagemaker, Endpoint and Lambda functions, as well as other python files (which are not included here), so it will no be able to run from here.
For the complete description and original files, please refer to https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment.git
